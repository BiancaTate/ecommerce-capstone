E-commerce capstone for Year Up LearnToCode Fall 2023

This project is the first Capstone Project for the LearnToCode course at year up for the Fall 2023 cohort. I have created an e-commmerce website for a nail shop. It includes a Home Page, Login, Sign-Up, Products Page, and a Check out page. This site includes a navigation bar with links that takes the user to each page. This project utilized bootstrap and other CSS properties. This site has a sleek, minimalistic aesthetic with many small details to help create a visually appealing experience for the user. It is also easy to navigate with clear navigation to each page. Each current page is highlated in the responsive navigation bar to assist the user in knowing where they are on the website.
